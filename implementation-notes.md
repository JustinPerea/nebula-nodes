# Implementation Notes

## 2026-05-26 — Codex chat agent

- Added Codex as a separate chat runtime rather than overloading the Claude runner. Codex has its own JSONL event stream, auth state, and resume command shape, so a dedicated adapter keeps the existing Claude/Daedalus paths untouched.
- Codex uses the local CLI login state (`codex login status`) instead of storing ChatGPT credentials in Nebula. This follows OpenAI's documented Codex auth model and avoids copying subscription tokens into `settings.json`.
- The Codex runner launches with `workspace-write`, `approval_policy="never"`, and local network enabled so it can call the Nebula CLI/backend without interactive approval prompts while still avoiding the full `--dangerously-bypass-approvals-and-sandbox` path.
- GPT Image 2 generation remains on Nebula's existing OpenAI/FAL nodes. ChatGPT-backed Codex auth is only for the Codex agent brain; Image API calls still require `OPENAI_API_KEY` or `FAL_KEY`.

## 2026-05-26 — Codex skill bootstrap

- Added a repo-backed skill bootstrap to the Codex runner instead of relying on private/global agent skill state. The bootstrap indexes `.agents/skills/*/SKILL.md`, lists available skills, preloads relevant root skill docs based on the user's message, and points Codex to tracked provider docs for exact node/API details.
- Kept preload bounded (`MAX_SKILL_BOOTSTRAP_CHARS`, `MAX_SKILL_DOC_CHARS`) so FAL's large model catalog remains available on disk without bloating every Codex turn.
- `.agents/skills` is not currently committed on `origin/main`; it exists locally as an untracked public-safe bundle. It needs to be added to the repo before the GitHub version has the same Codex/Nebula knowledge.

## 2026-05-26 — Agent connection instructions

- Added Claude auth status parity with Codex via `/api/agents/claude/status`. Nebula still does not collect credentials; it only reports the local CLI's installed/logged-in state.
- Added compact connection instructions inside the chat composer for Claude and Codex. They show the relevant local CLI login/status commands and open automatically when the selected CLI is missing, unavailable, or not logged in.
